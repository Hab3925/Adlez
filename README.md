# Adlez
Small zelda inspired game made in unity by a couple of friends in IT class :) 

Made during spring of 2021 as a project for IT class, and to learn the basics of Unity, C#, and the creation of sprites and animations. 

# Requirements
* Unity 2020.3.0f1
* Some version of the unity package that lets you paint sprites on a tilemap iirc

# To install
This is the Assets folder of the Unity project. Try making a unity project and drag and drop this repository into the asset folder and hope it works out of the box? Never done this sort of thing before so good luck. (Why are you trying to run this anyway)

# To run
Click the play buttin in unity editor.
